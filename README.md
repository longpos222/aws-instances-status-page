AWS-instances status page â€” it\`s custom Django apllication, based on AWS-API for getting overall and billing information about
available instances. Following example below consider needed content via table\`s field.

![overall_info](https://habrastorage.org/files/00b/35c/357/00b35c357efe4f28ba6244ddb1d6a215.png "Info about instances")

Users can\`t use it directly, but anyone programmer, followed particular tech stack and repo-author\`s own guide, might deploy
it for free.

## Configurations and requirements

General requiries are Python 3+, basic web-framework Django and Boto3 (custom API wrapper for AWS-API).
All list of requiries [by link](https://github.com/DmytryiStriletskyi/aws-heroku/blob/master/requirements.txt).
Further you need is [Heroku Cloud Platform](https://dashboard.heroku.com) accout.


## Deploy

[Install](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) heroku CLI to manage and scale your applications,
to provision add-ons, to view the logs of your application as it runs on Heroku, as well as to help
run your application locally.

Log in using the email address and password you used when creating your Heroku account.
```
$ heroku login
Enter your Heroku credentials.
Email: python@example.com
Password:
```

Clone the repository source code.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/DmytryiStriletskyi/aws-heroku.git
$ cd aws-heroku
```

Create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code.
```
$ heroku create
Creating lit-bastion-5032 in organization heroku... done, stack is cedar-14
http://lit-bastion-5032.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/lit-bastion-5032.git
Git remote heroku added
```

Now deploy your code:
```
$ git push heroku master
Counting objects: 232, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (217/217), done.
Writing objects: 100% (232/232), 29.64 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 232 (delta 118), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: Compressing source files... done.
remote: Building source:
remote:
remote: -----> Python app detected
...
```

The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:
```
$ heroku ps:scale web=1
```

Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name. As a handy shortcut, you can open the website as follows:
```
$ heroku open
```

You cant view logs with commands "heroku logs".
```
$ heroku logs
2017-03-29T18:17:55.780361+00:00 app[web.1]: 2017-03-29 18:17:55 [2] [INFO] Listening at: **** (2)
2017-03-29T18:17:55.780488+00:00 app[web.1]: 2017-03-29 18:17:55 [2] [INFO] Using worker: sync
```

If you need introduce in advance manage of cloud platform and other features - follow this [link](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#define-a-procfile).
Also you can return to start and refresh steps-memory with official Heroku guide and learn more.


## Config vars

I have a part of code [there](https://github.com/DmytryiStriletskyi/aws-heroku/blob/master/server_schedule.py), that contains
variables in Heroku-application environment. It`s tip for saving secret data not in code directly. Follow my way, please.
```
$ heroku config:set S3_KEY=8N029N81 S3_SECRET=9s83109d3+583493190 REGION='ea-east-1'
```
More about this into [link](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).
